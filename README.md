## 🔒 Private Projects (Titles Only)

> These are available by request or in demo format only.
- **ARTHER Project** - Explored, Modeled and developed core functionality of a Hypersonic Stealth Object Tracking. Next phase is AI integration comming soon
- Key Advances:
Military-Grade Realism: 
    * Launch → Boost → Glide phases 
    * Plasma wake effects >20km altitude 
    * Sensor-type specific detection 
Scientific Validation: 
    * Quadratic rocket ascent (step^1.5) 
    * Speed-dependent confidence scaling 
    * Kalman-filtered tracking 

- **Clinical Support Tool** - Exploring both rules-based and AI-driven engines to generate diagnosis suggestions from symptom descriptions. The backend (Ollama) runs on Windows, while the frontend runs in a Python venv on WSL due to LLM integration constraints. I’ll be posting this experimental tool soon for people to try out — just for fun! 
Rules-based engines are deterministic, auditable, and reliable for well-known, common diagnosis patterns. 
    * AI models (LLMs) can handle ambiguity and edge cases but: 
    * They may hallucinate or return non-validated diagnoses. 
    * They are not medically certified. 
    * They can introduce a level of uncertainty that, in a medical support tool, needs careful handling. 
So, the best architecture (especially for clinical tools) is often: 
    * Primary layer: rules_engine.py 
    * Fast, Reliable and Fully explainable 
    * Fallback layer: ai_engine.py 
    * If no match is found via rules, call the AI.

Upgraded and fully functional clinical decision support tool using rules-based/ai-based suggested treatment(s) After some research, I fine-tuned some of the inference parameters for the intended purpose of the ai_engine to achieve the following:  
   * Reduced hallucinations, ensuring deterministic, evidence-based outputs. 
   * Restricts suggestions to the most medically plausible options. 
   * Guarantees reproducibility for audits.  

- **ai_agents_suite** - A growing suite of modular AI agents built to automate complex tasks — from customer support to intelligent trading.
    Current Modules:
      Support Ticket Generator: Extracts structured data (customer, issue type, urgency, etc.) from natural language messages using local LLMs (Ollama) and stores them in MongoDB via a FastAPI backend.
      Smart Trading Agent (coming soon): AI-powered trading assistant capable of analyzing market trends, simulating strategies, and making informed buy/sell decisions.
- **ufos** – Fun project to record and view UFO sightings. Built with Python + lightweight DB.
- **air-bnb-test** – Basic Airbnb data test project using Python.
- **shipwrech** – Data project analyzing shipwreck records.
- **FastAPI_Modbus-PLC-Simulation** – Real-time PLC simulation with FastAPI + frontend dashboard + CSV logging.
- **air-bnb-app** – Airbnb-inspired Python web app.
- **skynet_bank** – Full-stack Per Scholas capstone project simulating a banking system.
- **airbnb-jupyter** – Data analysis of Airbnb data using Jupyter notebooks.
- **maintenance_management** – Preventive maintenance tracking system in Python.
- **git-test** – Full-stack exploration project using React.
- **Mock_Website** – Frontend HTML/CSS/JS/TS web project (in progress).
- **Gravitational-Pull** – C# and XAML-based physics project on WPF.
